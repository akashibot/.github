# Akashi - Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 09/05/2024_

At **Akashi**, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how the **Akashi** Discord bot operates and handles any information during your use of the bot. By using Akashi, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Data Collection
Akashi **does not collect, store, or process any personal user information**. We do not track or retain any identifiable information, including but not limited to usernames, messages, or interaction history. The bot operates within the scope of Discordâ€™s API and does not exceed its authorized permissions.

### 1.1 Stored Attachments
The only data that Akashi stores temporarily are attachments (such as images or files) that are sent in a channel where the bot is used. These attachments are stored to enhance user convenience by allowing you to reuse them without needing to re-upload. However:
- The stored attachments are automatically deleted once a new attachment is sent to the channel or the bot restarts.
- The developers **cannot** access these attachments during storage or after deletion.

## 2. No Personal Data Sharing
The developers do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your information with any third parties. Since Akashi does not retain user data, there is no personal information to be shared or sold.

## 3. Use of Discord Data
Akashi only processes the data that is necessary to function as a Discord bot, such as reading commands and responding to them. This data is handled in real-time and is not stored or logged by the developers or Akashi.

## 4. Data Security
Although Akashi does not store personal data, we take security measures to ensure that any temporary data (such as attachments) is handled securely. Attachments are deleted automatically as described in section 1.1, and no data is accessible by the developers or stored permanently.

## 5. Third-Party Services
Akashi does not use any third-party services that would require additional data sharing or processing.

## 6. User Control
You are in full control of how you interact with Akashi. You may:
- Remove the bot from your server at any time.
- Stop using Akashi if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy.

## 7. Changes to the Privacy Policy
The developers reserve the right to update or change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted here, and the updated date will reflect the most recent changes. Continued use of Akashi after modifications to this policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.

## 8. Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [belize@envs.net].

Thank you for using Akashi!
