# Domains Whitelist
Due the lack of proxy for Akashi, only a few domains can be used in Akashi's image commands. (this only applies to link option, any attachment sent inside Discord is valid)

This is made to protect the integrity of the server running Akashi.

You can email me via `belize@envs.net` and request a domain to be whitelisted *or make a PR*.

Thanks for using Akashi!
